## Summary:
The purpose of this assignment was to test my early knowledge of barebones HTML and CSS to create something every developer needs... a website and portfolio!!

## Steps:
1. I began by coding out the HTML elemets and text that I would need.
2. I started working on the header, which was tricky at first. I needed to make the exact position and margins/paddings for the "My Name" section.
3.I added in the white table along with styling elements (font color, etc.)
4. Choose and implemented a background.
5. Worked on footer. Did research on sticky footer and how to implement one.
6. Once the index.html was completed I was able to use a lot of styling for the other two pages. 
7. I created field tables and made them the right portions for the "Contact" page.
8. Chose photos for the "Portfolio" page and spaced them out by float left and then adjust the padding and margins (a trick I learned from Colt Steel's online bootcamp).
9. Made the 3rd and 6th images hidden with "visibility: hidden"
10. Tried to troubleshoot a couple of bugs, such as white space above footer on Portfolio page and not being able to have wrap around text on Info page without having the white space appear as well above the footer. I know it has something to do with floating but not sure how to troubleshoot both issues. 

## I hope you enjoy my first attempt at a website!!




## Structuring photos in alignment in portfolio section helped by watching Colt Steel's coding bootcamp on Udemy

## Footer on Portfolio page gave me trouble with white space. Unsure how to troubleshoot.
