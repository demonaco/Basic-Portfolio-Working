    <p>I am currently working towards becoming a full-time web developer!</p> 
    <p>I obtained my undergraduate degree from the University of Southern California and my background is in music and marketing. I've been working in the technology field for the past 5 years, where I started as an intern, and eventually moved up to managing all aspects of marketing for the employer I currently work for.</p>
    <p>Since working in tech, I've had a curiousity around how backend technologies work and have wanted to build my own application. I've seen amazing things our engineers have been able to create and I've thought "Hey! I can do that too!". </p>
    <p>Please feel free to peruse around this site and check out my work. If you'd like to get in contact with me regarding work opportunities, please reach out to me via the Contact link.</p>
